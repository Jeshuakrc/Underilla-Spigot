This is a base structure of a datapack that you can use to customise the world generation. The datapack must be in `world/dataoacks/`.

In this example Plain biome have no tree & overworld surface is generate around y=320 to be sur to have cave everywhere & sea level is at -63 instead of 63 to avoid ocean water being include in caves.
